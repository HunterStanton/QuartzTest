# QuartzTest
An example project using CAKeyframeAnimations and Quartz in a MacOS app. The only thing it does is open up and flash colors on the screen.

## Tech:
This app was built with the following technologies:
- AutoLayout for centering the label
- Quartz/Core Graphics for manipulating layers
- Core Animation for cycling the colors and tweening between colors

## EPILEPSY WARNING:
If you are prone to epilepsy, **do not open this app**. It produces flashing colors that may or may not trigger epilepsy. Better stay on the safe side.
